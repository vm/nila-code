Review the code changes in the current git diff for correctness, readability, and potential issues.

First, get the current git diff by running `git diff` to see what changes have been made. Then analyze the diff to:

1. Check for logical errors or bugs in the changed code
2. Verify code style and readability improvements or issues
3. Identify potential performance issues
4. Look for missing error handling
5. Check for proper documentation/comments
6. Verify that the changes align with best practices
7. Suggest any improvements

Focus only on the changes shown in the diff, not the entire codebase.
